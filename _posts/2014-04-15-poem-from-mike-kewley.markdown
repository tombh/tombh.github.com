>It's frustrating,    
>I know.

>You've read    
>all the books    

>and sat with    
>all the right Teachers    
>Guru's and Healers.    

>Yet your third eye    
>didn't twinge,    
>let alone open.    

>Your sacred Kundalini energy    
>didn't wake up and seems    
>to be sleeping deeper    
>then ever.    

>You didn't see visions    
>or lights    
>in your meditation,    
>you snoozed instead.    

>It's always like this;    

>You were in the ashram toilet    
>when Sai Baba    
>conjured gold    
>from air,    

>You had a coughing fit    
>just as your Guru explained    
>the meaning of life,    

>You were inside    
>eating momo's    
>as the Dalai lama    
>walked through the street.    

>Astral travel,    
>Chakra alignment,    
>Psychic powers,    
>Satori and Enlightenment,    

>You want it all.    

>and yet    
>it never seems    
>to happen.    

>You don't know    
>how lucky    
>you are.    

## Commentary
Why did Mike Kewley return to the Isle Of Man? To knead sourdough. Where else could enlightenment be but in the taste of
his bread?
