I am now a Digital Nomad; a software engineer of no fixed abode. I am attempting to travel around the world, starting and returning to Bristol, UK. I have
a rough plan, but I want to be flexible. It may take months or years. If you have any recommendations, or want to
meet me anywhere, let me know.

## Follow my progress
You can keep track of me in the usual places, like the blog on this website, and also my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/twombh) and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/tbuckleyhouston)

I will also be conducting a [Sponge Relay](/the-sponge-relay) as I travel.

My friend [Dave Frey](https://plus.google.com/u/0/+DaveFrey) is [taking screenshots](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipNEgeD46c24EDrun6alBsSiPcrw2Lxd5rqaIB-YgEpWqx-fChiSpBokVxP3SJw_5Q?key=YVUwUTFZX0ZRLWUyZG1KWi10ekh1Z0xLZW84UzBR) of our weekly meditation over Google Hangouts.
