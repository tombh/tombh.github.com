So I got a job working for a local web development company called [2bebrave](http://www.2bebrave.com), they're a fairly new company and I make the numbers up to 3. We do all the usual stuff; design, hosting, programming, SEO and so on, I would of course highly recommend our services. Our offices are at the [Create Centre](http://www.bristol.gov.uk/ccm/content/Environment-Planning/sustainability/create.en), where to rent office space the company needs to have certain green/environmental/ethical credentials, so the atmosphere there is pretty cosy and laid back, which is nice.

So, I've been thinking about doing a redesign of my site here, seeing as it will serve a different purpose now. I'm thinking along the lines of some kind of hand-drawn, skethed type thing; just grey's a single colour making up the pallete.
