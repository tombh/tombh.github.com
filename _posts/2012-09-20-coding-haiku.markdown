I'm hoping this is the first of a series. It's nothing more than a relaxed stroll through a trivial problem on my website. In it you get to see how I generally go about writing code and solving problems. It's nothing special, but nevertheless, it's how I spend most of my programming days.

This particular problem concerns caching my Twitter feed via a server-side cron job to speed up page loads.
