I needed to create these custom signin buttons for a recent project, you might like to use them in yours. They're based on Rogie King's work over at [Komodo](http://www.komodomedia.com/blog/2009/06/sign-in-with-twitter-facebook-and-openid/) and so are licensed under the same [Creative Commons license](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/), which means they are free to use as long as you acknowledge the original author and use the same license.

[Download a Zip of all three](http://www.tombh.co.uk/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/signin_buttons.zip).
