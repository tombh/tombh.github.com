I've had the idea for this website for a couple of months now, and been making it offline for a couple of weeks. It's not completely finished but today's the day it's ready to go online. So here it is.

Some links don't work yet or they send you to funny looking places. But I can write blog entries and you can enter memories into the colour memory database -- which I'm quite excited about. The database just started off as a something to practice my programming skills on, but now that it's up there, live on the world wide web thing, I can't wait to see what everyone will make of it.
