My notes on Swedish pronunciation after advice from Emma Eurenius. These are currently only the long vowel sounds.

  * __a__: *are*
  * __b__: -
  * __c__: *ss*
  * __d__: -
  * __e__: *ay* from 'okay' but more *ugh*, reminds me of welsh '*ehh*, no'
  * __f__: -
  * __g__: could be *g*, *ch*, *ee*
  * __h__: -
  * __i__: *ee*
  * __j__: *yuhee* with friction
  * __k__: -
  * __l__: *eluh*
  * __m__: -
  * __n__: -
  * __o__: *ooo* like the shock of seeing someone get hurt, with rounded lips though
  * __p__: -
  * __q__: *k*
  * __r__: trilled
  * __s__: *ss*
  * __t__: -
  * __u__: no analogy, maybe ghosty but not, try starting with french 'u' then go back and down
  * __v__: -
  * __w__: *v*
  * __x__: *ks*
  * __y__: french 'u', but much more open rounded lips
  * __z__: *ss*
