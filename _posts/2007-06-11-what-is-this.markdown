So if i'm going to be saying stuff on this blog I must start with one of the most important questions there must possibly be - What is this existence thing?

OK, so I don't pretend to have the answer, but I do know that it is here, that it came about somehow, apparently out of nothing, and confidently seems to be hanging around for a while longer! It's in everything, the stars, computers, people, feelings, words, food, you name it, it's there. But it's not really a thing though in itself, not like a misty substance that infuses everything, in fact, despite its ubiquity, it seems utterly unfindable and ungraspable - frustratingly so.

To be honest, it's rather a lot to take in, it's size, variety, mysteriousness and it's rather unfriendly promise to remove me from it at some unspecified point in the future. Yet, by that same token, I also find myself sometimes feeling rather exhilarated and privileged to be part of such a huge and unique adventure!
