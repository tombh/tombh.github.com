At 7pm, on Tuesday, November 30th in [The Pervasive Media Studios](http://www.pmstudio.co.uk/about-pervasive-media-studio), Bristol there'll be a traditional [Underscore](http://www.under-score.org.uk/pipermail/underscore/) skillswap on the subject of _Social Network Application Development_.

It's free! But please [book a ticket first from Eventwax](http://bristolskillswap.eventwax.com/social-network-application-development) first.

Since the Web got its 2.0 badge, there's been a lot of stuff about social things, Facebook, Twitter, Wikipedia, etc. We'll ask questions like; How significant is the Social Web now? How does one build websites and applications for it? And where is it all going?

We're hoping to provide a, somewhat controversial, underlying theme throughout that the disparate and 'walled garden' Social Web of today is similar to the early unorganised days of email and that open formats, standards and protocols will soon unify our social experience on the Internet.


## Current speakers are;


_Thomas Buckley-Houston_
Facebook application developer and Open Social Web advocate. [tombh.co.uk](http://tombh.co.uk/about)
