*Broadcast 16th of December 2013 on BBC Radio Bristol*

A famous Buddhist once quipped that, “meditation is just one insult after another”. Even though he was being overly dramatic, I can relate to it. My mind is constantly pointing out, how I’m not good enough and where my life could do with improvement. It’s one of the main reasons it’s so hard to sit still without distraction and just simply pay attention. Who wants to be insulted!?

It’s as if my mind is carelessly littering the streets of my awareness. If only I could take a moment before thoughtlessly making yet another sweeping judgement on myself. 

“I know I didn’t do as much work as I could have today, but I doubt that’s proof that I’m irredeemably lazy.”

“Yes it is and nobody loves you.”

“No it’s not and there are people who deeply care for me.”

And so on and so forth.

I am uneasy about our Mayor’s idea to exhibit the accumulation of a weekend’s worth of litter today. Though I must say I sincerely appreciate his intention; we’re very lucky to have someone so genuinely concerned. It’s just that pictures of our laziness will circulate the media, inevitably leading us to reflect on how we’re not good enough and that we need to improve. Where are the gestures that tell the other side of the story?

It reminds me too much of my own mind. Even after 12 years of daily meditation the insults still continue, I’ve just learnt to accept there’s no pleasing my mind! So allow me to make that gesture for us. I think Bristol is a beautiful city and I personally thank you for helping make it that way.
