				<h1>I've written a book</h1>

<span class="post_date">20 August 2009</span>

<p><img src="/images/tlb-208x300.jpg" alt="tlb" />I'm proud to announce that my first book, <em>The Last Beyond,</em> <a href="/images/the_last_beyond.pdf">is available for download</a>.</p>

<p>I never knew how much time and effort went into making a book, of course the actual writing is a significant task, but then the editing, re-editing, notes, bibliography, typesetting, cover/art work and all the rest of it has taken me just as much time. All in all, from when I jotted down the first word to its availability on the intertubes, over three years have passed. And it's only a moderately sized book, maybe 16,000  words, that's 80 or so pages.</p>

<p>So what's it about? Well, there's a nice little description on the back cover which you can read on Lulu.com, but basically it's a collection of six essays exploring spiritual and philosophical topics often pitched from an autobiographical perspective — so no computer programming I'm afraid! The idea to write a collection of essays, rather than the more typical, series of chapters, was influenced by a few things; firstly I think the fact that, only months previously, I had completed a degree, played a part, but I was also inspired by the ostensibly narrative-less structure of <em>The Faith To Doubt</em> by Stephen Batchelor and the series of collected essays by Chris Arthur (Irish Nocturnes, Irish Willow and Irish Elegies), the acclaimed writer who also happened to be one of tutors.</p>

<p>And is it any good? Well you'll have to find out for yourself!</p>
