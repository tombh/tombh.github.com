				<h1>Thought For The Day &#35;27</h1>

<span class="post_date">02 June 2014</span>

<p><em>Broadcast 2nd of June 2014 on BBC Radio Bristol</em></p>

<p>Audio available at <a href="http://www.mytalky.com/w0i">http://www.mytalky.com/w0i</a></p>

<p>So reports are circulating that the Prime Minister is prepared to pull Britain out of Europe if Jean-Claude Juncker becomes president of the European Commision. It’s hard to know Cameron’s true motivations through all the political spin. But after the somewhat surprising European Election results I think it’s fair enough that the theme of national identity is more on people’s minds than usual.</p>

<p>My politics are generally left wing. Part of which is the belief that we all have a responsibility to help each other. I generally think we work better together and, though it may be a simplistic way of looking at it, I think that’s reason enough to be part of Europe.</p>

<p>That being said, there is part of me that is inspired by statements of independent spirit. Like Scotland for example. I don’t want them to leave, but there’s something appealing about their confidence that they can make it alone. Ironically, it’s that kind of hardy attitude that makes me want them to be part of my gang, so to speak.</p>

<p>Being in a relationship whether it’s romantic or geo-political requires a huge amount of courage to be honest. Take the Northern Irish peace process for example. That didn’t come about by either side pretending they were something they weren’t. They deeply disagreed with each other and let each other know about it.</p>

<p>So in some twisted sense I like disagreement. If someone has the guts to let me know how they feel, I may not like it, but at least there’s an opportunity for dialogue. Which is the only way we can move on and grow.</p>

<p>So perhaps next time I get into an argument with someone I should threaten to leave the relationship to form my own sovereign independent state.</p>
