				<h1>The Alps</h1>

<span class="post_date">27 December 2015</span>

<p>From the French Alps through to the Swiss and German Alps, I have spent a total of about a month in Europe's largest
mountain range. I arrived in Chamonix at night and woke up to this view from my bedroom window...</p>

<p><img src="/images/alps/room.jpg#mega" alt="" /></p>

<p>That there is the Mont Blanc massif. It contains the highest peaks in Europe, most of them over 4000m. I got to climb
Aguilles Marbrées, a 3535m peak. It was the first time I'd ever used an iceaxe and crampons and also the first time I'd
felt the breath-quickening lack of oxygen caused by high altitudes.</p>

<p><img src="/images/alps/aguilles.JPG#wide" alt="" /></p>

<p>But most of my time I spent at <a href="http://www.theskilocker.com/">The Ski Locker</a>, a coworking space for other digital
nomads. It was a fantastic place to be to get that extra motivation to toil at the coal face with other similarly fated
souls.</p>

<p>It's hard to explain exactly what it's like living next to such huge mountains. Every time you walk out the door
you're struck by enormity. I never got used to it. Here's a shot of Mürren high street, a village nestled in the Swiss
Alps, with The Eiger (3970m) just hanging about in the background...</p>

<p><img src="/images/alps/street.jpg#wide" alt="" /></p>

<p>Leaving Chamonix was the end of nearly 2 months in France. I'm glad to say that my French improved a lot. I've developed
my own method of language learning, involving the famous Michel Thomas course to get me off the ground, then moving on
to Youtube videos, especially dubbed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDKrsgmozbo">Peppa Pig</a> episodes, to push me further.
I've started on German now and the approach seems to be working here too. Maybe I'll write up a Tom BH guide to learning
languages!</p>

<p>First I took the train to Interlaken, a rich town in Switzerland famous for being near the valleys where JR Tolkein
got inspiration for some of the landscapes in Lord of the Rings. I had the huge good fortune to stay with well-known
and cherished local musician <a href="http://www.uelivonallmen.ch/standard.asp?PageID=ueliVonAllmen">Ueli von Allmen</a>.
He welcomed me to his home and the town. We had some great jams together and he gave me lots of history about the town.</p>

<p>I then took what is perhaps the most beautiful train ride of my life, to Lucerne, further north in the Swiss Alps. These
are the kinds of scenes I saw from the train window!</p>

<p><img src="/images/alps/train.jpg#mega" alt="" /></p>

<p>A lot of trains in Switzerland have special windows. Some have windows that go all the way to the floor, you can see
people's legs from outside. And some have windows, almost in the roof like this...</p>

<p><img src="/images/alps/train_roof.JPG#wide" alt="" /></p>

<p>I only spent a couple of nights in Lucerne. It's an exquisite town, more so than Interlaken. It
has an older, modest feel. Weirdly Interlaken has loads of really expensive shops, selling jewelery, watches, designer
clothes and so on. It's like walking through Kensington in London. So Lucerne is a bit more understated. It also has a fantastic
bouldering centre. I've been missing Fontainebleau a lot, those quiet forests, endless boulders, walking home in the
sunset, sore hands and the birds singing in the trees. Anyway, behold, Lucerne...</p>

<p><img src="/images/alps/lucerne.jpg#mega" alt="" /></p>

<p>I'm in northern Bavaria now, the horizons are much further away. It's actually quite nice to not be in such intense
surroundings! In fact, I'm in the middle of nowhere really. Which is just what I need because soon I will start 6 days
of silent meditation. I still haven't come across anywhere in the world that compares to the vistas of a stilled mind.</p>
