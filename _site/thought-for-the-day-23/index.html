				<h1>Thought For The Day &#35;23</h1>

<span class="post_date">07 April 2014</span>

<p><em>Broadcast 7th of April 2014 on BBC Radio Bristol</em></p>

<p>How often do you listen? I mean really listen? The nearest I have to pets are some pretty little ladybirds living in my window frame. Now and again I see them delicately crawl across the glass. They’ve become familiar and I’ve grown fond of them. Though not quite enough to give them names yet. One time when I was sitting in meditation I heard the most quiet kind of rattling go past my head. At first I was confused. I’m used to noises from the neighbours and the wind outside, but this was different. I thought about it for a good while until I suddenly realised it was of course a flying ladybird. My suspicion was later confirmed when I got up and looked behind me to see the red and black spots of the insect on my door.</p>

<p>I was oddly pleased with myself that I’d managed to identify a bug merely by the sound of its flight. It’s surprising the level of detail we can perceive when we quieten down and open ourselves to the environment.</p>

<p>Think of the weight of significance that lies behind the signals coming from the Indian Ocean. What must it be like to hear those pings live on a radar machine? Potentially they are our final remaining connection to the 239 human lives of Flight MH370.</p>

<p>The volume of a sound is not related to its significance. I find this useful to remember in life. How can I be attentive to the things going on in and around me that aren’t loudly tugging at my attention? I don’t know the secret but I do know that ladybirds make better pets than you’d first think.</p>
