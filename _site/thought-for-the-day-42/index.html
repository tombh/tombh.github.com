				<h1>Thought For The Day &#35;42</h1>

<span class="post_date">20 March 2015</span>

<p>Broadcast 20th of February 2015 on BBC Radio Bristol</p>

<p>So literally, as I speak, the Moon is passing in front of the Sun. They do both spend a lot of time in the sky, so it’s not totally surprising that one would occasionally eclipse the other. Still, it’s quite a rare event for the UK, partial eclipses occur every few years and total eclipses can sometimes take many decades before happening again.</p>

<p>We probably know from the movies that ancient civilisations thought eclipses were mysterious acts of the gods. But now we know, it’s just because of the orbit of the planets.</p>

<p>I’m a computer programmer and mostly an atheist too. But even so, there are times when things happen on my computer that I have no explanation for. I’ll be doing the same thing that I’ve done every day in the same way for months, then suddenly it doesn’t work. I try to fix it but nothing helps. Then just as mysteriously as it broke, it fixes itself for no reason. And for a moment I can’t help but wonder if it was just that the planets were misaligned or something.</p>

<p>In fact, in all seriousness, you can actually get software that will stop you doing things on your computer if any of the planets are in alignment. Of course it’s a bit of a joke, but I think it says something true about humans. Even the most logical minds amongst us appreciate that there are hidden movements in the universe that can’t be completely explained.</p>

<p>I don’t personally believe in any kind of god, but that doesn’t stop me being in awe of how the universe works. So I shall be waiting until the eclipse is over before I get back to my programming this morning.</p>
