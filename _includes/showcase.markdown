I glued together various tools to render a complete Linux desktop into a TTY terminal. Complete with mouse and
keyboard input. I made it to be used over MoSH (SSH) so that I can use a complete modern browser on very low
bandwidth connections. It got to [the front page of Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11744221).

In the Autumn of 2014 I walked solo 270km from North Wales to my flat in Bristol. Somewhat of a pilgrimage I managed to
document the adventure on video, which [you can now watch it on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6uQ0RfoOVC4).

Possibly the most complex software I've ever written. This is a [Heroku](https://heroku.com)-inspired service that
allows you to host and scale your own [12 Factor Apps](http://12factor.net). It got on
[the front page of Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7540681).

I gave a short talk at TEDx Bath about vulnerability. It used pictures of cats with their heads sticking through pieces of bread, people laughed.

This is an ambitious project to try and archive all the dharma talks (Buddhist-themed teachings about meditation) on the Internet. There's about 17 thousand at the moment. It's written using Ruby's Sinatra to adhere to traditioanl REST specifications.

</a>

I was, for a while, actively involved in the <a href="http://www.puppylinux.org">Puppy Linux</a> community during which time
I developed a popular derivative called <a href="http://www.murga-linux.com/puppy/viewtopic.php?t=24871">wNOP</a> that
automatically configured the OpenGL Window Manager, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ImW0-MgR8I&amp;feature=related">Compiz-Fusion</a>, 'out-of-the-box'. So I am told, tens of thousands of copies
have been downloaded.
