##About me

![picture "Picture of Tom BH"](/images/tomisme.jpg "Tom is me.")
Hello, I'm Thomas Buckley-Houston, but you can call me tom. I live in Bristol, UK.

If it wasn't for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source_software">open source software</a> I doubt very much
whether I'd be working in computers, so the fact that the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY5skobffk0">the very foundations of the web are
grounded in openness</a> makes me very excited.

In the real world I like to meditate and spend time at <a href="http://www.gaiahouse.co.uk/">Gaia House</a>. I have a degree in Religious Studies and like to read,
<a href="http://www.tombh.co.uk/ive-written-a-book/">write</a>
and <a href="http://www.beingordinary.org">podcast</a> about spiritual matters.

Please feel free to get in touch &mdash; <strong>tom<span style="display:none">nospam</span>@tombh.co.uk</strong>
